**opencv4nodejs allows you to use the native OpenCV library in nodejs. Besides a synchronous API the package provides an asynchronous API, which allows you to build non-blocking and multithreaded computer vision tasks. opencv4nodejs supports OpenCV 3 and OpenCV 4.**

**OpenCV is native libraries which help Appium performs images matching by comparison. This way helps automation tasks a lot on Mobile. Appium is a JS Foundation Project, so we need to use opencv4nodejs to integrate with many binding programing languages.
Opencv4nodejs allows you to build non-blocking and multithreaded computer vision tasks and this one supports both OpenCV 3 and OpenCV 4.**

Here is installation [**guideline**](https://wiki.linecorp.com/display/LINESET/How+to+install+OpenCV+for+Appium) manually to binding the **webpack** for Appium Foundation.
